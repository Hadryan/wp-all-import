== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*What are the differences between the Lite and Professional editions?*
The Professional edition adds support for Custom Fields, Custom Post Types, recurring/scheduled imports, downloading/importing of images, and [more](http://www.wpallimport.com/upgrade-to-pro/). 

*What size files can WP All Import handle?*
Generally, WP All Import can comfortably handle files of up to 100Mb in most shared hosting environments (GoDaddy, HostGator, etc.). On VPS or dedicated hosting environments, the size of file WP All Import can handle is only limited by the power of the server. When importing very large files it is recommended to split them into chunks and import each chunk individually.

*Does my CSV have to be in any particular format?*
Use pretty much any delimiter you want. It has to work with the [fgetcsv](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv.php) PHP function.
